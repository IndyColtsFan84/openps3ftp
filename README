OpenPS3FTP is an open source ftp server for the PS3. It implements all of the basic FTP
functions, and a few advanced ones (like CHMOD). Also, it mostly complies with RFC 959.

Default login:
- username: root
- any password accepted

If this is a development build, please use with caution. There might be stuff that isn't
working right.

Source code git: http://git.dashhacks.com/openps3ftp
License: GPL (version 3)

To compile the source, you must have installed the latest version of ps3toolchain on your
build machine. This will also install PSL1GHT, which is required.

Running the `make pkg` command should compile everything and create a nice pkg file for you.
