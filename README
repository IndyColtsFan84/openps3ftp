=== OpenPS3FTP README v2.0 ===

.: Default Login Details :.
Username: root
Password: openbox

A "nopass" version is included for those who prefer to use anonymous login.

.: Description :.
OpenPS3FTP is a minimalistic open source File Transfer Protocol ("FTP") server 
by jjolano for the PlayStation 3. It was written using the PSL1GHT SDK found at 
http://psl1ght.com/ (git: http://github.com/HACKERCHANNEL/PSL1GHT).

.: License :.
This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. The source 
code (along with source trees of previous versions) is available at the 
OpenPS3FTP git repository:
- Version 1.5 and prior: https://github.com/jjolano/openps3ftp
- Version 2.0 and later: http://git-hacks.com/openps3ftp

.: General Usage Tutorial :.
Just a small tutorial on the basics.

Prerequisites:
- Custom Firmware (tested on 3.55, but should work for all)
- A network connection

Installation:
- Extract the pkg files from the archive and copy them into a USB drive
- Connect the USB drive to your console and select the pkg file under the
  "Install Package Files" menu (found under Game)

    Note:
    The pkg file that you select should correspond to the custom firmware you 
    are using. For example: if you have installed geohot's 3.55 jailbreak, use 
    the file "openps3ftp.geohot.pkg". If not, use "openps3ftp.pkg". Users of 
    CFW 3.55 kmeaw can use any pkg.

- OpenPS3FTP is now installed!

Usage:
- Launch OpenPS3FTP (found under Network)
- Wait until you see text on the screen.
- Connect to your console using an FTP client (such as FileZilla) with the IP 
  address and port shown on the screen with user root and password openbox.
- Now that you're connected, you can browse through and manipulate files on 
  your console as if it were a folder on your computer.
